## Build a 360-degree customer view in AWS using a powerful set of analytics tools

One of the challenges of digital transformation across companies is the task of consolidating customer data in one place, what we call a 360-degree customer view. This is a powerful concept in CRM (Customer Relationship Management) used on a daily basis on marketing, sales and customer services areas. Gather and aggregate information to build such view help us to have a complete vision of who are our customers, what are their preferences, what they have looked for, and how their preferences are correlated to other people preferences and behavior.

This implementation can be used to refine customer personas, their behavior and expectations, get to know touchpoints of interaction, perform a better post-sale service, cross-selling or up-selling, build personalized recommendation, map customer journey, and identify the gaps in channels or processes.

The common pain point is that information about customer is spread across several systems inside your company, from customer interaction with your call center records to events related to customer search behavior, you have several different data that are difficult to correlate if you don’t have a Data Lake strategy.

This blog post demonstrated how to bring data from different data systems as a set of customer dimensions and build a 360-degree customer view as a baseline for all customer analytics initiatives.
